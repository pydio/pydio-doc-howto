In this how-to we are going to take a closer look at the visibility parameters on the shared resources, we will see what they are, how to enable them and some use cases to display their work.

### Cells ownership

With Pydio Cells you can define the **Visibility (2)** of your resource (a cell in this instance) which enables you to transfer the ownership with users, groups or even roles.
What it means is that they have the ability to act as if it was their own resource therefore they have the same rights as if they have created the resource and add users,etc...

Often times this setting(**Visibility (2)**) can be confused with **Shared with (1)** which is the entity with whom you are going to share the resource,they can also interact with it such as reading or modifying.

### Share links ownership

In the case of a common workspace where multiple users have access, you can choose to display your link to some of them and/or allow them to edit its settings.

This is an example of a common workspace (common-files) where two different users have access (`admin`, `jess`), in this first couple of screenshots you can witness that the setting is disabled (screenshot **1**) (the user `jess` is not selected) and therefore he does not see the sharelink on the file(Desert 6.png) (screenshot **2**).

Now we add the user (`jess`) to the list of users and give him **view**(sees the link in the workspace) and **edit**(enables the user to modify the share settings as if it was his own) rights(screenshot **3**) and now you can now notice(screenshot **4**) that he has the link listed on his view and he also can **right-click >> edit share**.

### Use case

* For instance you have a user that is going to take a vacation and he has important resources with clients so before he leaves he should give the visibility to another of his co-workers which will enable him to have access to the resource.
