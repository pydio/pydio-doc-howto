### Managing ownership of shared resources

[:image-popup:/authentication/auth_group_LDAP.png]

With Pydio Cells you have the ability choose the **Visibility (2)** of your resource which enables you to transfer or share the ownership of the resource with users, groups or even roles.
What it means is that they have the ability to act as if it was their own resource therefore they have the same rights as if they have created the resource and add users,etc...

Often times this setting can be confused with **Shared with (1)** which is with who you are going to share the resource and also if they can interact with it such as reading or modifying it.

### Use cases

* For instance you have a user that is going to quit and he possesses shared resources with clients and therefore you do now want to loose them, you can for instance transfer the ownership to yourself (or a group, etc....).
