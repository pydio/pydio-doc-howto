### Specific Cells parameters

To configure your external and bind for Cells you run the following command:

```
./cells configure sites
```

* **Bind Address**: is the interface and port used to bind Cells on the server.

* **External URL**: is the url used to access Cells from outside (in this case, the reverse proxy).

### Basic NGINX reverse proxy configuration

To have the latest nginx version follow the official nginx documentation (https://nginx.org/en/linux_packages.html).

```nginx
server {
    server_name my-cells-server.com;
    client_max_body_size 200M;

    location / {
        proxy_pass https://localhost:8080;
        
        # this line is required for cells-sync
        # grpc_pass grpcs://localhost:8080;
    }


    location /ws/ {
        proxy_pass https://localhost:8080;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection "Upgrade";
    }

    error_log /var/log/nginx/cells-proxy-error.log;
    access_log /var/log/nginx/cells-proxy-access.log;

    listen [::]:443 ssl;
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    
    # certificate configuration (in this case generated by certbot)
    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/my-cells-server.com/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/my-cells-server.com/privkey.pem;
    include /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf;
    ssl_dhparam /etc/letsencrypt/ssl-dhparams.pem;

}

server {
    if ($host = my-cells-server.com) {
        return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
        }


        listen 80;
        listen [::]:80;
        server_name my-cells-server.com;
        return 404;
    }
```

> This config was updated with nginx version: nginx/1.20.0

### Cells Sync

**Mandatory section for the Sync Client to work behind a Nginx reverse proxy.**

If your Cells Server is running behind a Nginx reverse proxy you must meet 2 requirements and then add the config below to your main nginx reverse proxy configuration.

- You need TLS encryption between Cells and Nginx.
- HTTP 2 need to be enabled like this `listen 443 ssl http2;`.

#### Finale note

Make sure to substitute the values of the **certificates** and **ip/domains**.
