abstract: "This guide is assuming a vanilla install of Server 2012 R2 and lists all prereqs to get Pydio up and running with IIS 8.5 / Server 2012 R2. I have found that none of the current guides cover everything 100% so through lots of testing and looking at all the other guides I wrote this one."
