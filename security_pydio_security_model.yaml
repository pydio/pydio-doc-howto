title: "Pydio security model"
abstract: "Storing all your organization information in a SaaS-based Box service can prove to turn into a nightmare: are the provider’s 
          servers located in a country that is compliant with your juridiction? Is the service provider trust-worthy? Can he actually read the data? 
          And eventually let third-party read them (like NSA…)? And what if a trainee has opened a 'box' last year, and no one can close it anymore? 
          Will she still see all the documents forever??"
