title: "Upgrading from 6.0.8 to 6.2.0 for our existing clients"
abstract: "If you are currently running Pydio 6.0.8 along with our existing set of enterprise plugins (core.licence, custom.gui_customize), you can migrate to our new Enterprise Distribution. After the migration, you will not need to maintain custom plugins anymore, as they are directly part of the distribution. You can also choose to upgrade to the latest community edition and stick to this edition. See at the bottom of the page for that operation."
