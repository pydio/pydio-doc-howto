### A MORE PRECISE TUNNING USING THE GUI
In this guide we will see with a few examples on how to use some of the **custom parameters** that you can set through the GUI.

#### 1. CUSTOMIZED PARAMETERS FOR USERS/GROUPS/ROLES
You can add additional parameters/actions to **USERS/GROUPS/ROLES**, you can find them in **Workspaces & Users > People > and select/modify the USER/GROUP/ROLE > Customize Parameters** that you want to perform the action on.

Now that you're in this menu you can choose the parameter/action that you want to add by clicking on the **"+"** button and give it the value that you want.

#### 2. CUSTOMIZED PARAMETERS FOR WORKSPACES
Users/Groups/Roles can have custom  **WORKSPACES** parameters/actions.
You Can choose to target all the workspaces or only the ones that you chose.

+ **All Workspaces Parameters** : You have two choices here either ALL the workspaces or the SHARED ones.
Then you can expand it by clicking on it, and add a parameter/action by clicking on the "**+**" button.
