_This guide describes the steps required to have Pydio Cells running on a CentOS/RHEL 7 or 8 server._

## Prerequisites

### Database

The only hard requirement is a running MySQL database server. We recommend using MariaDB, version 10.4.

#### MariaDB

We currently use MariaDB 10.4, here is the [official installation guide on the MariaDB website](https://downloads.mariadb.org/mariadb/repositories/#distro=CentOS&version=10.4&distro_release=centos8-amd64--centos8).

Double check that the system specifications are OK and follow the detailed instructions.

After installation, you should enable and start the service:

```sh
sudo systemctl enable mariadb
sudo systemctl start mariadb
```

#### MySQL

Install MySQL official community release repository.

```bash
sudo rpm -i http://dev.mysql.com/get/mysql-community-release-el7-5.noarch.rpm
sudo yum update

# install mysql-community-server package
sudo yum install mysql-community-server

# Set mysqld to start after reboot
sudo systemctl enable mysqld

# start the service now
sudo systemctl start mysqld
```

#### Post install configuration

By default, a new database is created by the system during the installation process. You only need a user with database management permissions.

If you would rather do it manually, you may create a dedicated user and an empty database by executing the following SQL queries :

```SQL
CREATE USER 'pydio'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '<your-password-here>';
CREATE DATABASE cells;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON cells.* to 'pydio'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

### SELinux

There is no available configuration of SELinux for Pydio Cells. Please make sure that SELinux is disabled or running in permissive mode.

To temporary disable SELinux: `sudo setenforce 0`.

You can also permanently disable SELinux in `/etc/selinux/config`.

### Dedicated User

It is recommended to use a dedicated non-admin user to run Pydio Cells.

In this guide, we use **pydio** and its home directory **/home/pydio**.

In order to create a new user and its home directory execute this command:

```sh
sudo useradd -m pydio
sudo passwd pydio
```

To switch to this user:

```sh
su - pydio
```

## Install Pydio Cells

```sh
# As pydio user, downlaod the latest version
wget https://download.pydio.com/latest/cells/release/{latest}/linux-amd64/cells
chmod u+x cells
```

Run the installer:

```sh
cells configure
```


Once finished, start Cells with:

```
./cells start
```

and access the web ui through your domain or address under the port **8080** (for instance `https://domain.com:8080`).


To configure a different interface and port for cells, run the following command.

```
cells config sites
```

**Running Cells as a service is a good way to ensure that you have your server running if an event such as a power failure or else happens.**

Refer to our knowledge base for a comprehensive guide on how to setup your Cells instance as a service.

## Troubleshooting

### SELinux is enforced

If, after a successful installation and when you try to navigate to the main application page with your browser, you land on a blank page with following message:

> Access denied.

ensure you have modified SELinux to be in permissive mode.
