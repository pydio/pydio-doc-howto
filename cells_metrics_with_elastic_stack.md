In this how to, we are going to see how you can retrieve logs, system informations and more by setting up the ELK stack along Cells.

### Elastic stack

"ELK" is the acronym for three open source projects: Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana. Elasticsearch is a search and analytics engine. **Logstash** is a serverâ€‘side data processing pipeline that ingests data from multiple sources simultaneously, transforms it, and then sends it to a "stash" like **Elasticsearch**. **Kibana** lets users visualize data with charts and graphs in Elasticsearch.

Now with a new component the stack is most commonly referred as _Elastic Stack_.

There is a new component, **Beats** which is somewhat a lightweight _logstash_ that has multiple variants for instance, Filebeat which is focused on files, logs, Metricbeat is focused on sending system and service statistics.

### Install Kibana and Elasticsearch on the server that is going to process the data

Actually you could install them all in different machines for resource management but for our example Kibana and Elasticsearch are going to run on 1 server.

* First, let's make sure that you have **Java 8** by running `java -version`, otherwise to install java 8, use the following commands (for this example openjdk is used but you can use Oracle's Java).

```bash
sudo apt install openjdk-8-jdk-headless
sudo apt install openjdk-8-jre-headless
```

- Then add the elastic repository,

 - **Debian** users might need this software `sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https`

```bash
wget -qO - https://artifacts.elastic.co/GPG-KEY-elasticsearch | sudo apt-key add -

echo "deb https://artifacts.elastic.co/packages/6.x/apt stable main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/elastic-6.x.list

sudo apt update
```

* Now you are ready to install Kibana and Elasticsearch, let's proceed;

```bash
sudo apt install elasticsearch
sudo apt install kibana
```

Once both installations are complete some settings have to be changed in the configuration.

_You might require root rights to edit the config files._

For Kibana you must edit `/etc/kibana/kibana.yml`:

* Change the address/port :

```yaml
 server.host: "address"
 elasticsearch.hosts: ["http(s)://address(or domain name):port"].
```
- **elasticsearch.hosts** should have the same address than your kibana and the port will depend on your next steps.

Then for Elasticsearch edit `/etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml` and edit:

```yaml
network.host: <address>
```

To the address where your elastic is running.

Once the modifications are done, start the services,

```bash
sudo systemctl start elasticsearch
sudo systemctl start kibana
```

(if you want them to start automatically after a manual restart or if your server fails.)

```bash
sudo systemctl enable elasticsearch
sudo systemctl enable kibana
```

### Logstash and/or beats to fetch metrics

For this part you can use logstash as a standalone or use a lightweight version called **Beats**.
**Logstash** has builtin all type of metrics whereas **Beats** depends on the type that you are going to use,of course you can use many beats at the same time.

Examples of beats:

* Filebeat: which focuses solely on fetching from a log file (like a `tail -f <file>`)

* Metricbeat: can retrieve metrics (such as CPU, RAM, ....) from services or even application such as one in go (you will have to add some code to let the beat retrieve metrics from your application).

* And many more.

In our case we just want to fetch logs from one instance of Cells so we are going to use **Filebeat** (a beat specialized in fetching files, in this case a log file written in JSON)

### Basic configuration for Cells

First set a filebeat on the machine running Cells,

For **Debian/Ubuntu** machines use the following:

```bash
curl -L -O https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/beats/filebeat/filebeat-6.6.1-amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i filebeat-6.6.1-amd64.deb
```

Once it's installed edit the `/etc/filebeat/filebeat.yml`, and change the following lines according to your setup,

```yaml
#-------------------------- Elasticsearch output ------------------------------
    hosts: ["ip:port"]

    protocol: "http/s"
    username: "elastic"
    password: "changeme"

#============================== Kibana =====================================
    host: "ip:port"
```

Now for the logs part add/edit the following settings,

```yaml
#=========================== Filebeat inputs =============================
    enabled: true
    paths:
     - /home/cells/.config/pydio/cells/logs/cells.log

    json.keys_under_root: true
    json.overwrite_keys: false
    json.add_error_key: true
```

_What it does is read the json file(cells.log) and parse it so that elastic + kibana can use the data_

Now lets test the config and start the beat,

```
sudo filebeat test config
sudo filebeat test output
```

You can use the test commands to make sure that everything is good, that the beat can reach kibana and elastic and that your `filebeat.yaml` is correct.


You can setup and start your filebeat.

```bash
sudo filebeat setup
sudo systemctl start filebeat
```

(do not forget to use `systemctl enable filebeat` once your set to have it start automatically at each start)
